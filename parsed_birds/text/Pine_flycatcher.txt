The pine flycatcher (Empidonax affinis) is a species of bird in the Tyrannidae and the tyrant flycatchers family. It is found in the montane tropical and subtropical coniferous forests of Mexico and southwestern Guatemala. A vagrant bird found in the Santa Rita Mountains, Arizona, in late May 2016, was the first record north of Mexico. (An erroneous 2009 record from Choke Canyon State Park in southern Texas was later shown to be a misidentified Least Flycatcher.)
