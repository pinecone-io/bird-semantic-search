Spizella monticolaSpizella arboreaPasserella arborea

The American tree sparrow (Spizelloides arborea), also known as the winter sparrow, is a medium-sized New World sparrow.

In 2014, the American tree sparrow was moved to its own monotypic genus, Spizelloides, from genus Spizella, based on polyphyly in Spizella and multilocus molecular evidence suggesting the species was strongly divergent from other extant genera.

Measurements:

Adults have a rusty cap and grey underparts with a small dark spot on the breast. They have a rusty back with lighter stripes, brown wings with white bars and a slim tail. Their face is grey with a rusty line through the eye. Their flanks are splashed with light brown. They are similar in appearance to the chipping sparrow.

Their breeding habitat is tundra or the northern limits of the boreal forest in Alaska and northern Canada. They nest on the ground. American tree sparrows migrate into southern Canada and the United States to spend the winter.

These birds forage on the ground or in low bushes, often in flocks when not nesting. They mainly eat seeds and insects, but also eat some berries. They are commonly seen near feeders with dark-eyed juncos.

This bird's song is a sweet high warble descending in pitch and becoming buzzy near the finish.
