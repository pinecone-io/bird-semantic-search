The yellow-throated nightingale-thrush or Gould's nightingale-thrush (Catharus dryas) is a species of bird in the family Turdidae native to Central America. It was first described in 1855 by the English ornithologist John Gould.

In 1878, the Sclater's nightingale-thrush (Catharus maculatus) was categorized as a subspecies of Catharus dryas based on the similar plumage. In 2017, a study showed that Catharus maculatus was not a subspecies of Catharus dryas, but a separate species of Spotted nightingale-thrush. The publication cited DNA sequencing, vocal data, and modeling of ecological niches as evidence that the two organisms were, in fact, different species.

Three subspecies are recognised:

It is found from southern Mexico to Honduras. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, and inland wetlands.

It has a lifespan of around 4.2 years, and is not considered a migratory species.
