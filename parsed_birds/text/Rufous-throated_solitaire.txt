The rufous-throated solitaire (Myadestes genibarbis) is a species of bird placed in the family Turdidae.

It is found Jamaica and Hispanoila, and in the Lesser Antilles on Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.

The bird is nicknamed the siffleur montagne (or mountain whistler) in Dominica; a local folk group of the early 1970s, the Siffleur Montagne Chorale, named themselves after it. In the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, the bird is called solitario gorjirrufo.

The subspecies M. g. sibilans is sometimes considered a full species, as the Saint Vincent solitaire (Myadestes sibilans).
