The tawny-crested tanager (Tachyphonus delatrii) is a species of bird in the family Thraupidae. It is found in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, and heavily degraded former forest.

An analysis of measurements taken from more than 200 adult specimens showed positive relationships between latitude and four morphological characters: wing length, tail length, bill length and bill width.
