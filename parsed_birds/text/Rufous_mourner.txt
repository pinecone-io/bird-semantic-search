The rufous mourner (Rhytipterna holerythra) is a small passerine bird in the tyrant flycatcher family. It breeds from southwestern Mexico to northwestern Ecuador. It was formerly believed to be a cotinga, but well-supported anatomical evidence has shown it to be related to tyrant flycatchers of the genera Myiarchus, Sirystes and Casiornis.

The rufous mourner is 20 cm (7.9 in) long and weighs 40 g (1.4 oz). Its plumage is entirely rufous, brighter on the underparts, and with darker brown wings. The base of the bill is pink or horn-coloured. The call is a drawling way teeer and the song is wee hi hi weeur-weeur-weeur.

This bird is found in lowlands and foothills up to 1,200 m (3,900 ft) altitude in wet forests, adjacent old second growth, semi-open areas and shady plantations. The rufous mourner is seen alone, in family groups or as part of a mixed-species feeding flock. It perches on a twig from which it sallies forth to catch large insects and caterpillars and many seeds and fruit. Usually, the food is taken in flight.

It nests in tree cavities, especially old woodpecker holes. It may also nest in holes in earth banks.
