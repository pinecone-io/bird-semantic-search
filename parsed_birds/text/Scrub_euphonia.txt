The scrub euphonia (Euphonia affinis) is a species of bird in the family Fringillidae.

Euphonia affinis is divided into several subspecies. The species E. godmani of the Pacific coast of central Mexico is now considered to be a full species, West Mexican euphonia (Euphonia godmani).

Both sexes have a thin, fine bill, smaller than that of other euphonias. Legs and eyes are dark. The male is bright yellow below and black above, with a small yellow spot on the forecrown. The crissum is white. Females have a grey head, dusky olive upperparts, buff-grey underparts, and white belly and crissum.

Its nest is a globular structure with a side entrance, placed in tangles of vegetation or another protected place. The eggs number 2â€“5 and are whitish with brown speckles.

The scrub euphonia ranges on both coasts of Mexico, south from the states Sonora and Nuevo Leon, and much of the country east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, including the Yucatan Peninsula. It is found throughout Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua and along the Atlantic and Central and Northern Pacific coastal lowlands in Costa Rica. It can be found in areas of secondary growth, stands of trees, agricultural areas and gardens and other human-disturbed areas.

The scrub euphonia is frequently found in association with yellow-throated euphonias, as well as in mixed species feeding flocks. It consumes much fruit, being particularly attracted by mistletoe berries.

This is a vocal species. Its calls include a bright dwee dwee dwee, a plaintive syeeu syeeu and a twittering flight call, slip slip. Their songs are variable, including si chi-chi-chi-si and a liquid, twittering warble.

This bird is widespread and evaluated as least concern by the IUCN. It can adapt to human-altered environments and is a common bird throughout its large range.
