Carduelis notata

The black-headed siskin (Spinus notatus) is a species of finch in the family Fringillidae. It is found in Mexico, Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forest and heavily degraded former forest.

Recent work suggests the species radiation happened much later, within the last 1 million years, and posits the radiation happened due to climate change in the late Pleistocene. The changing climate could have fragmented various habitats in the Andes, initiating allopatric speciation.
