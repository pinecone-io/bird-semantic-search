The slate-throated whitestart, slate-throated redstart, or slaty-throated whitestart (Myioborus miniatus) is a species of bird in the family Parulidae native to Central and South America.

The slate-throated whitestart is a long-tailed warbler measuring 12 cm (4.7 in) long. It has a deep rufous head, dark back, and contrasting bright yellow breast, belly and white vent and tail tips. The bill is black, and the legs are blackish-gray.

While most of its plumage changes little throughout its large range, the underparts grade from yellow in most of its range, to red in the northernmost part.

It is found disjunctly in humid highland forests, from upper understory to mid canopy, in Mexico, Central America, the Andes from western Venezuela to northwestern Argentina, the Venezuelan Coastal Range, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the tepuis. It occurs at around 600 to 2,500 m (2,000 to 8,200 ft) above sea level.

In July 2024, a specimen was spotted in the Sigmund Stern Recreation Grove of San Francisco, California. The sighting was confirmed by multiple birdwatching enthusiasts. This is the furthest north the species has ever been observed.

Pairs remain together throughout year, often accompanying mixed flocks. It hops and flits about while flashing its tail to frighten insects which are then caught in aerial pursuits. It will occasionally take protein corpuscles from Cecropia plants and will occasionally glean insects from tree bark.

The slate-throated whitestart's call note is a sharp "pik" note. The song varies with region, although throughout most of range it is a varied series of whistled notes, some slurred up, some slurred down.

From April to May, pairs nest in a bulky, roofed structure with a side entrance, usually nestled in niche in bank or steep slope. The female lays 3, or sometimes 2, speckled white eggs.
