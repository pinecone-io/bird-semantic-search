The masked tityra (Tityra semifasciata) is a medium-sized passerine bird. It has traditionally been placed in the cotinga or the tyrant flycatcher family, but evidence strongly suggests that it is better placed in Tityridae, where it is now placed by the South American Classification Committee.

It is found in forest and woodland from Mexico, through Central America, to northwestern and central South America (as far south as Paraguay).

Measuring 20 cm (7.9 in), it has a black-and-whitish plumage, and a distinct red eye-ring and base of the bill. The mask is black in the male, while it is brownish or greyish in the female. The male resembles the black-tailed tityra, but can be separated by its smaller black face mask (does not include the nape) and white tail-tip.
