Arremon torquatus costaricensis Buarremon torquatus costaricensis Buarremon costaricensis

The Costa Rican brushfinch or grey-striped brushfinch (Arremon costaricensis) is a species of bird in the family Passerellidae. It lives in the undergrowth of humid forest, especially near the edges, at altitudes of 300 to 1,200 metres (980 to 3,940 ft) in Panama and Costa Rica.

The Costa Rican brushfinch is often treated as a subspecies of the stripe-headed brushfinch (A. torquatus), but was determined a distinct species, together with the black-headed brushfinch, on the basis of differences in vocalization, plumage, and genetics.
