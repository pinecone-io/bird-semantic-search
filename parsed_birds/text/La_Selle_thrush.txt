The La Selle thrush (Turdus swalesi) is a species of bird in the family Turdidae endemic to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (split between the Dominican Republic and Haiti). A skulker of broadleaf and pine forests around 1300m, it is limited to a small and declining population in the inland Dominican Republic, as well as a relict population in Haiti.

Its name is derived from Pic la Selle, Haiti's highest point.

Turdus swalesi is found only on Hispaniola. Two subspecies are described: T. s. dodae has been recorded from the mountain ranges of the Cordillera Central and Sierra de Neiba in the Dominican Republic, and the La Visite National Park in Haiti, while the nominate subspecies T. s. swalesi is found in the Sierra de Baoruco as well as Massif de la Selle. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane habitats.

The La Selle thrush is threatened by habitat loss.

Despite usually shy behavior, it often boldly approaches roads and other human artifacts. It only usually sings at dusk and dawn, when it is most active.
