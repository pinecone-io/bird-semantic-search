The rufous-collared thrush (Turdus rufitorques) is a species of bird in the family Turdidae.

It is endemic to highlands of Middle America, south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, occurring in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Chiapas state in Mexico. Its closest relative is the American robin, and like that species, it is found in varied habitats, from towns to forest. It is, however, restricted to highland areas with at least some trees. It is also known as the rufous-collared robin.

The species is widely distributed and assessed as fairly common, and is listed under the category of Least Concern under the IUCN Red List. However, the global population is believed to be declining.
