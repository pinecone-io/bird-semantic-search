Basileuterus tristriatus chitrensis

The black-eared warbler or Costa Rican warbler (Basileuterus melanotis) is a species of bird in the family Parulidae. It was previously considered conspecific with the three-striped warbler and the Tacarcuna warbler.

The black-eared warbler measures 13 cm (5.1 in) in length. It is mostly olive-brown with a buffy belly and underparts. It has distinct black and white striping on the head and a dark cheek. Male and female three-striped warblers have similar plumages.

Their song is a rapid series of squeaky chirps.

It is native to the Talamancan montane forests. It typically forages on the ground, especially near riparian areas.
