The white-vented euphonia (Euphonia minuta) is a species of bird in the family Fringillidae.

Euphonia minuta measures approximately 9.5 cm (3.7 in). Both sexes have a whitish midbelly and crissum. Males are blue-black above with a yellow forehead. Their throats are purple-black and their underparts are bright yellow. Females are olive-green above with whitish throats. Their calls consist of single notes, beem or seeu.

Euphonia minuta is found in two disjunct populations. The first ranges from southern Mexico south along the Pacific coast to northwestern Ecuador, the second across northern South America from the eastern Andean foothills as far east as the state of Par√° in Brazil, and south to northern Bolivia. Its natural habitats are the canopies and borders of moist woodland.

White-vented euphonias often associate with other Euphonia species, forming mixed species flocks.
