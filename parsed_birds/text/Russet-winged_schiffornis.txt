The russet-winged schiffornis (Schiffornis stenorhyncha) is a species of Neotropical bird.

It is found from Panama to northern Colombia and northern Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests and subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.

It is medium-sized, about 24 cm (9 in.) long.

The russet-winged schiffornis has traditionally been placed in the manakin family, but evidence strongly suggest it is better placed in Tityridae, where it is now placed by the South American Classification Committee.

The species was split by the AOU in 2013 from the species complex Thrush-like Schiffornis.
