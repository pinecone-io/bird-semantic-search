A drab olive or olive-grey bird, the mangrove vireo has yellow lores and two white wing bars. Sexes are similar. It is approximately 10 cm (3.9 in) long. There are two disjunct populations of this vireo: Caribbean and Pacific. The Caribbean population has both yellow and grey colour phases, while the Pacific population has no colour phases.

It is found in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests, and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland. The Pacific population is restricted, as the name suggests, to mangroves, while the Caribbean population occupies a wider range of habitats.

The IUCN has classified this species as being of Least Concern.
