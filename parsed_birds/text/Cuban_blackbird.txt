Ptiloxena atroviolaceus Dives atroviolaceus

The Cuban blackbird (Ptiloxena atroviolacea) is a species of bird in the family Icteridae.

It was previously placed in Dives, but now classified in its own genus, Ptiloxena.

Measuring 27 cm (11 in) long, this species has entirely black plumage with a slight violet sheen on the upperparts. The only non-black body part is the brown eye.

It is endemic to Cuba, where it is widespread and common. It is entirely absent from the Isla de la Juventud and some of the offshore cays. Its natural habitats are lowland moist forests and heavily degraded former forest.
