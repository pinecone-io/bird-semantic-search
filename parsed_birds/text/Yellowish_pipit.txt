Anthus lutescens Pucheran, 1855

The yellowish pipit (Anthus chii) is a species of bird in the family Motacillidae. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are temperate grassland, subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, and pastureland.

Prior to 2022, its scientific name was Anthus lutescens, but based on a 2021 study, the International Ornithological Congress renamed it to Anthus chii, the name by which Louis Pierre Vieillot described this species in 1818, which has precedence over the name Anthus lutescens.
