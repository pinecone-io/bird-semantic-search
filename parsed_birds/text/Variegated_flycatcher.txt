The variegated flycatcher (Empidonomus varius) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae. With the crowned slaty flycatcher being moved to its own genus, this is now the only species remaining in Empidonomus.

It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and the Guianas; it is a vagrant to more northwestern parts of the continent.

Accidental in North America north of Mexico, there have been only ten records: Maine (1977), Tennessee (1984), Ontario (1993, 2020), Washington (2008), Florida (2013, 2015, 2021), Texas (2016), and Michigan (2022).

It is similar to the smaller piratic flycatcher and larger sulphur-bellied flycatcher.
