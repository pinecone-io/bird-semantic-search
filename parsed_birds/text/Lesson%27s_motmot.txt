Lesson's motmot (Momotus lessonii) or the blue-diademed motmot, is a colorful near-passerine bird found in forests and woodlands of southern Mexico to western Panama. This species and the blue-capped motmot, whooping motmot, Trinidad motmot, Amazonian motmot, and Andean motmot were all considered conspecific.

The central crown is black and surrounded by a blue band. There is a black eyemask. The call is a low owl-like ooo-doot.

The Lesson's motmot has three subspecies:
