Hylophilus ochraceiceps

The tawny-crowned greenlet (Tunchiornis ochraceiceps) is a species of bird in the family Vireonidae and is the only species placed in the genus Tunchiornis. It is found in Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest.

The tawny-crowned greenlet was formally described in 1860 by the English zoologist Philip Sclater. The specimen had been collected in the state of Oaxaca of southwest Mexico by the French ornithologist Adolphe Boucard. Sclater coined the binomial name Hylophilus ochraceiceps. The specific name combines the Modern Latin ochraceus meaning "ochraceous" with -ceps meaning "-capped". The species is now placed in the monotypic genus Tunchiornis that was introduced in 2014.
