The Panama flycatcher (Myiarchus panamensis) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae. It is found in Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama, and Venezuela. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, subtropical or tropical mangrove forest, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, and heavily degraded former forest.

A molecular genetic study published in 2020 found that the Panama flycatcher is sister to the short-crested flycatcher (Myiarchus ferox).
