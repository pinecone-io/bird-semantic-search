Pallas's rosefinch (Carpodacus roseus) is a species of bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It is found in China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Mongolia, and Russia. Birds are occasionally reported from further west and there are records from several European regions, including Britain, but the cage-bird trade makes the origin of some such birds hard to assess. Its natural habitats are boreal forests and boreal shrubland.

Pallas's rosefinch is around 16â€“17.5 cm in length. It is a medium-sized to large slender rosefinch with a long notched tail.
