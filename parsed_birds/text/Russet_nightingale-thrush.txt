The russet nightingale-thrush (Catharus occidentalis) is a species of bird in the family Turdidae. It is endemic to Mexico.

Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.

Its closest relative is the hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus) of temperate North America.

The crown, back and wings of the russet nightingale-thrush are brown, and the face is pale gray. Its throat and belly are also pale gray, with a slightly washed dusky shade. The breast is similarly pale gray and mottled dusky. Juveniles are more strongly mottled on breast and sides than adults.

This species is very similar to the related ruddy-capped nightingale-thrush (Catharus frantzii). They can be differentiated by song or in flight, by the presence of a yellow bar on the secondary feathers below the wing in the russet nightingale-thrush.
