The grey-collared becard (Pachyramphus major) is a species of bird in the family Tityridae. Its genus, Pachyramphus, has traditionally been placed in Cotingidae or Tyrannidae, but evidence strongly suggests it is better placed in Tityridae.

It is found in Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. In 2023, the gray-collared becard was seen at Resaca de la Palma State Park near Brownsville, Texas.

Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forest, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest, and subtropical or tropical moist montane forest.
