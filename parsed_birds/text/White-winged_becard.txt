The white-winged becard (Pachyramphus polychopterus) is a species of bird in the family Tityridae. It has traditionally been placed in Cotingidae or Tyrannidae, but evidence strongly suggest it is better placed in Tityridae, where it is now placed by the South American Classification Committee. The species contains 8 subspecies that vary markedly in plumage and voice, and it has been suggested that they represent more than one species.

It is found in Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Chile is the only country of South America where the white-winged becard does not occur. The white-winged becard ranges east of the Andes cordillera, except in Colombia and Ecuador.

The white-winged becard inhabits a range of habitats, typically from lowlands to 500 m (1,600 ft), but on occasion as high as 200 m (660 ft).
