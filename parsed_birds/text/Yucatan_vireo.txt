The Yucatan vireo (Vireo magister) is a species of bird in the family Vireonidae.

Closely related to the red-eyed vireo, its plumage a duller overall. It measures 14.5–15.5 cm (5.7–6.1 in). It has a stout, hooked bill that is gray, paler at the base. A broad white eyebrow contrasts with a dull gray crown. A broad dark stripe runs through the brown eye. Upperparts are a dull olive gray. Throat and underparts are whitish. The wings and tail are dark with olive green margins. Legs and feet are grayish blue.

Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests, and heavily degraded former forest.

It is found in Belize, Honduras, Mexico, as well as on Grand Cayman. There is a well-documented record from High Island, Texas, in 1984, but this is the only record for the United States.

Four subspecies are recognized, the large number reflecting its distribution amongst far-flung islands and a small strip of the mainland.
